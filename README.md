<br> <br> This addon is still very rough. I don’t even know what I’m making, and I’m not sure if it will be useful or completely useless. If you can optimize it or create a much better version, please go ahead and let me know, because I’d love to use it too :kissing_heart:

## Features 
- Generate bone from selected vgroup
- Generate bones from all vgroups
- Automatically connect generated bone the vgroup
- Just check screenshot below and try it yourself :tired_face:
